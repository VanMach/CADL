Some jupyter notebooks based on the lectures of
Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow (CADL) MOOC at Kadenze
https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow/info

Hope to keep up with the lectures over the course.
Lecture2_8 notebook still has some unsolved problems/errors 

To use, cpoy the notebook files into the correct session directory for that session (session-i)
and use them like the assignement notebooks provided.

Tested with docker image on Win7(64x).
Use at your own risk.
